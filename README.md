## Dataset

The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of data science and machine learning. It contains four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and three classes of iris flowers (setosa, versicolor, and virginica).

## Data Exploration

- Loaded the Iris dataset.
- Visualized the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of iris flower types.

## Data Preprocessing

- Split the data into a training set and a testing set.
- Handled any missing values (not applicable for this dataset).

## Model Building

- Built a decision tree classifier using scikit-learn.

## Model Evaluation

- Evaluated the model's performance using accuracy as the metric.
- Displayed a classification report to provide more insights.

## Results

- Achieved an accuracy of [insert accuracy here].
- Visualized the decision boundary of the model.
